[00:00.63] Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
[00:03.88] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[00:07.88] They say in Heaven, love comes first
[00:11.81] We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
[00:15.61] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[00:31.11] 
[00:37.26] When the night falls down
[00:41.23] I wait for you, and you come around
[00:44.96] And the world's alive
[00:49.43] With the sound of kids on the street outside
[01:11.43] 
[00:53.45] When you walk into the room
[00:57.45] You pull me close, and we start to move
[01:01.28] And we're spinnin' with the stars above
[01:04.68] And you lift me up in a wave of love
[01:22.68] 
[01:08.67] Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
[01:12.28] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[01:16.26] They say in Heaven, love comes first
[01:19.73] We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
[01:24.22] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[01:39.72] 
[01:30.96] When I feel alone
[01:35.04] I reach for you, and you bring me home
[01:38.59] When I'm lost at sea
[01:42.75] I hear your voice, and it carries me
[02:00.75] 
[01:46.20] In this world, we're just beginnin'
[01:51.22] To understand the miracle of livin'
[01:54.28] Baby, I was afraid before
[01:58.23] But I'm not afraid anymore
[02:11.23] 
[02:02.29] Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
[02:06.15] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[02:10.13] They say in Heaven, love comes first
[02:13.88] We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
[02:19.57] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[02:35.07] 
[02:33.36] Heaven
[02:36.36] 
[02:43.67] Heaven
[02:46.67] 
[02:48.66] Heaven
[02:51.66] 
[02:52.66] In this world we're just beginnin'
[02:56.96] To understand the miracle of livin'
[03:00.33] Baby, I was afraid before
[03:03.29] But I'm not afraid anymore
[03:16.29] 
[03:13.34] Heaven
[03:22.65] Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
[03:25.94] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[03:29.98] They say in Heaven, love comes first
[03:33.93] We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
[03:37.73] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[03:41.44] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[03:56.94] 
[03:45.41] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[03:49.29] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[03:53.08] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
[03:57.23] Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
